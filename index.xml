      <description>Welcome&amp;nbsp;Â¶Glad you found my page. I want to share some of the impressions I was able to capture through my (digital) lens.
Also I am always curious to learn new concepts. Especially the progress in the field of Machine Learning (a.k.a. Artificial Intelligence) is really fascinating. In this blog I want to collect some of the codings I did over the years and to share ideas for novel learning approaches.</description>

I published my first Streamlit App! Have a look at it to find out more about machine learning for fish type classification.
