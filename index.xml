      <description>Welcome Glad you found my page. I want to share some of the impressions I was able to capture through my (digital) lens.
Also I am always curious to learn new concepts. Especially the progress in the field of Machine Learning (a.k.a. Artificial Intelligence) is really fascinating. In this blog I want to collect some of the codings I did over the years and to share ideas for novel learning approaches.</description>

      <description>I like to prototype new concepts into code to better understand them.
Currently still struggling to pick sides (Team Python vs. Team R).
Check out some of my projects on my GitHub page.
More coming soon&amp;hellip;</description>
